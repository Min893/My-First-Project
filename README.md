Hello, Everyone!

In this project, I would like to build a brandnew website to introduce a famous 1960's rock brand from America-The Beach Boys.  From this website, you will discover the following:

•	The band history-a 1960’s rock band with 51 years experience of performing live at numerous events around the world. You have been given the following requirements after interviews with the client’s representatives:
•	Their primary target audiences-their fans and potential fans who wish to use the site to see and hear clips from their back catalog, and any new material as it becomes available.
•   Their music and publicise their availability to perform at events such as weddings and Christmas parties.

Also you will find showcase on the website:
•	Photos of the band members
•	A vedio clip
•	An audio clip
•   Social media links like: Facebook, Twitter and YouTube pages.


Wishing you a very enjoyabe surfing experience!
